SimpleARAndroid
===============
In this post we build a simple AR app that positions a 3D model in a 
particular location in the scene. We create a marker based on the sceneâ€™s
contents. In particular we show how to:
- Match feature points with a reference location in the scene
- Construct the camera intrinsic matrix.
- Estimate the pose in each frame
- Display a 3D model at the reference location

You can point at the floor and double-tap to create a marker out of the
scene's contents. This marker image will be continuously tracked and a
3D model will be displayed at the original location. Please ensure that
you choose a reference marker location that has sufficent features.

The project will run on devices with ABI armeabi-v7a.
